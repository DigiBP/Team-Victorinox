## Quality of Life ePRO (Questionaire) Form

This Google form is filled by the patient on a monthly basis. In this case, it is specifically tailored to a patient who has been prescribed a medication to help treat chronic migraines. In future iterations of the program, we would generate a questionaire that applies to every type of medical condition that could conceivably be treated by a drug in Phase IV clinical trials. This particular iteration of the PRO-form is based on the recommendations found in the European Medical Agency's (EMA) regulatory guidance for the use of health-related quality of life (HRQL) measures in the evaluation of medicinal products and the Migraine-Specific Quality-of-Life Instrument (MSQOL) - a measure designed to assess the quality of life of migraineurs.
